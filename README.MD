### CIS 6930, SPRING 2024 ASSIGNMENT 2

## HRISHIKESH BALAJI (3299-8859)

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW

THIS PROJECT, DEVELOPED AS PART OF CIS 6930, SPRING 2024 ASSIGNMENT 2, FOCUSES ON AUGMENTING DATA EXTRACTED FROM PUBLIC POLICE DEPARTMENT PDF RECORDS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO PROCESS AND AUGMENT THESE RECORDS FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS, KEEPING FAIRNESS AND BIAS CONSIDERATIONS IN MIND. THE PROJECT'S CODEBASE ENABLES USERS TO DOWNLOAD PDF FILES FROM SPECIFIED URLS, EXTRACT INCIDENT RECORDS, AUGMENT THE DATA, AND INSERT IT INTO A SQLITE DATABASE FOR FURTHER PROCESSING.

#### GETTING STARTED

##### PREREQUISITES

- PYTHON 3.8 OR HIGHER
- DEPENDENCIES LISTED IN `PIPFILE`

##### INSTALLATION

1. ENSURE PYTHON AND PIPENV ARE INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM.
2. CLONE THE REPOSITORY TO YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.
3. NAVIGATE TO THE PROJECT DIRECTORY AND RUN `PIPENV INSTALL` TO INSTALL REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES.
4. ACTIVATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT BY RUNNING `PIPENV SHELL`.

##### USAGE

TO RUN THE SCRIPT, USE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND FROM THE PROJECT ROOT DIRECTORY:

```
PIPENV RUN PYTHON ASSIGNMENT2.PY --URLS <FILENAME>
```

WHERE `<FILENAME>` POINTS TO A CSV FILE CONTAINING THE URLS OF THE PDF FILES TO BE PROCESSED.

#### FEATURES

- DOWNLOADS PDF FILES FROM SPECIFIED URLS.
- EXTRACTS INCIDENT RECORDS FROM THE DOWNLOADED PDF FILES.
- AUGMENTS THE DATA BASED ON SPECIFIED CRITERIA, INCLUDING DAY OF THE WEEK, TIME OF DAY, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AND MORE.
- INSERTS AUGMENTED DATA INTO A SQLITE DATABASE FOR PERSISTENCE AND FURTHER ANALYSIS.

#### KNOWN BUGS AND ASSUMPTIONS

- ASSUMES THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PDFS FROM THE PUBLIC POLICE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE REMAINS CONSISTENT.
- WEATHER DATA AUGMENTATION REQUIRES A RELIABLE API KEY FOR FETCHING HISTORICAL WEATHER INFORMATION.
- ASSUMES THAT THE CENTER OF TOWN IS AT THE FIXED COORDINATES (35.220833, -97.443611) FOR DETERMINING THE SIDE OF TOWN.

#### TESTING

TO ENSURE THE CORRECTNESS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION, THE FOLLOWING TEST FILES ARE PROVIDED UNDER THE `TESTS/` DIRECTORY:

- `TEST_TIME.PY`: TESTS THE EXTRACTION AND PROCESSING OF INCIDENT TIMES.
- `TEST_NATURE.PY`: TESTS THE PARSING OF THE NATURE OF INCIDENTS.
- `TEST_GEO.PY`: (HYPOTHETICAL) TESTS THE DETERMINATION OF THE SIDE OF TOWN BASED ON INCIDENT LOCATIONS.

#### RUN THE TESTS USING THE COMMAND:

```
PIPENV RUN PYTHON -M PYTEST
```

#### EXTERNAL RESOURCES
